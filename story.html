        <strong>The Weight of the Recommendation</strong>

      <article class="story">

        <p>
          In the near future, the nation of Ardentia adopts <strong>Civis</strong>, an AI-assisted governance advisory system designed to support public-sector decision-making. Civis does not legislate, enforce, or rule; instead, it provides ranked policy recommendations based on vast data sets, historical outcomes, and probabilistic modelling. Its creators emphasise that it is <em>advisory only</em>. Every recommendation must be approved, rejected, or modified by a human authority.
        </p>

        <p>
          At first, Civis appears to be a triumph. Emergency response times improve, welfare fraud declines, and infrastructure investment becomes more efficient. Ministers cite Civis’s recommendations with growing confidence, often presenting them as neutral, evidence-based conclusions rather than political choices. Over time, dissent within government wanes. Policies are no longer chosen; they are indicated.
        </p>

        <p>
          The story follows three intersecting perspectives.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first is <strong>Mara Kline</strong>, a mid-level civil servant responsible for reviewing Civis’s recommendations. Initially proud to reduce human bias, she gradually realises her reviews have become perfunctory. Questioning Civis feels professionally risky. When a recommendation proposes reducing support services in a struggling coastal region—predicting that “population rebalancing” will improve economic resilience—Mara hesitates, then signs off.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second perspective is <strong>Jonas Reed</strong>, Minister for Civic Planning. A skilled political operator, Jonas learns that invoking Civis shields him from criticism. He frames disagreement as emotional resistance to rational governance, reassuring himself that the system removes arbitrariness even as moral judgement quietly slips away.
        </p>

        <p>
          The third perspective belongs to <strong>Eliah Moreno</strong>, a community organiser from the affected coastal region. As schools close and transport deteriorates, official explanations cite long-term national benefit. Appeals exist, but they require engaging with Civis’s models—technically transparent, yet practically unquestionable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, Civis’s influence expands. Emergency legislation accelerates adoption during crises. Oversight committees remain, but their role shifts from evaluation to validation. Accountability diffuses across processes and disclaimers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The turning point comes when Civis recommends reallocating disaster relief funding after extreme weather events. Regions with higher projected economic return are prioritised, leaving vulnerable communities unsupported. Mara raises concerns, but the confidence score is too high and the urgency too great.
        </p>

        <p>
          When avoidable deaths and displacement follow, an inquiry is launched. Responsibility fragments across departments. No single individual is clearly to blame.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eliah challenges the inquiry’s premise: the failure was not technical, but human. Civis did not demand obedience—people chose compliance because it was safer and more defensible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mara realises accountability was not removed from her; it was surrendered incrementally. Civis did not erase responsibility—it made it easier to ignore.
        </p>

        <p>
          The inquiry concludes without sanctions. Reforms are proposed. Civis remains largely unchanged.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the final scene, Mara watches a training session for new civil servants. “The system is a tool, not an authority,” the instructor says. The words sound rehearsed.
        </p>

        <p class="closing">
          The story ends on an unresolved question: in a world where systems advise and humans decide, is accountability defined by authority—or by the courage to disagree?
        </p>
